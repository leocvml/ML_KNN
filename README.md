# ML_KNN
 my first ML_Algorithm
 KNN
  
  
  1.calculate the distance between input and the current data \n
  2.sort the distances in increasing order
  3.take k item with lowest distances to input
  4.finnd majority class among these item
  5.return majority class as out predict for the class of input
